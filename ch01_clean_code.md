- There will always be code. Code is tranlation from business requirements to well specified instructions that computers can execute.


- I have dealt with bad code a lot! Going through spaghetti code and hoping for some hint, some clue, of what is going on; 
    but all we see is more and more senseless code. There is no structure to the code. 


- Spending a lot of time to even find what I'm looking for in the code I have written!


- The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.


- Bad code tempts the mess to grow!


- I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, 
    the dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to an articulated strategy


- Bad code tries to do too much, clean code is FOCUSED and it does one thing well.


- Minimal dependencies.


- Code, without tests, is not clean. No matter how elegant ot readable it is. 


- Shorter code is better.


- Good code is written by someone who cares. Someone has taken the time to keep it simple and orderly.


- We are constantly reading old code as part of the effort to write new code.


- Continuous Improvement: checked-in our code a little cleaner than when we checked it out.
